 I wear many hats, and always have a thirst for knowledge. Prior to software development I have experience as a fashion designer, in large scale manufacturing, and technical design. I have also, learned how to consult in mortgage finance with close communication to all moving parts.  My roots in hospitality have taught me about thriving in a fast-paced high volume environment that requires detail-oriented professionalism.

I am a self-starter that thrives on setting goals and achieving them with the highest of standards. Not every task can be achieved in one way, which is why </br>I love to work on a team where multiple great minds can come together and create something that was never thought possible. 

Problem solving invokes a fire that always has me asking "how" and "why" do these things work? My thought when working on a project no matter what subject, is always "who" am I going to make a better experience for? My team, my company, the client, or the world?
